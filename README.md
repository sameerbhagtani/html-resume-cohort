# HTML Resume

## Project Overview

This repository contains a strictly semantic HTML5 resume. It was developed as an assignment for the ChaiCode Web Development Cohort 2026.

This project is part of my [ChaiCode Web Dev Cohort 2026 Archive](https://github.com/sameerbhagtani/web-dev-cohort-2026). Checkout my entire journey there!

## Technical Features

- **Semantic Architecture:** Strategic implementation of `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` to define a clear document content model.
- **Accessible Tabular Data:** Implementation of the `scope` attribute within table headers for screen-reader compatibility and the `<time>` element for machine-readable dates.
- **Metadata Optimization:** Inclusion of a descriptive meta tag for SEO and a favicon link for browser-level recognition.
- **Structural Hierarchy:** Precise management of heading levels (`h1` through `h3`) and horizontal rules (`hr`) to ensure logical content flow and visual clarity.
